title: "Quick tip: simple unique jobs on Solid Queue"
---

I recently migrated from Sidekiq to [Solid Queue](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue) on a personal project, and generally found the transition to be quite painless. However, at the time of writing, Solid Queue doesn't support unique jobs, either natively or through a 3rd party gem. (Sidekiq has both, through the popular [sidekiq-unique-jobs](https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs) or via its [Enterprise offering](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Ent-Unique-Jobs).)

The good news is that native support seems to be [in progress](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue/issues/176), but in the meantime, it's quite easy to roll your own unique job class using the `around_enqueue` callback and a simple query against Solid Queue's `Job` table.

```ruby
---
filename: app/jobs/unique_job.rb
---
class UniqueJob < ApplicationJob
  around_enqueue do |job, block|
    # `.scheduled` scope == all unfinished jobs
    if SolidQueue::Job.scheduled.where(class_name: job.class.name).none?
      block.call # enqueue the job
    else
      Rails.logger.info("Skipping #{job.class.name} because it is already present")
      # If we don't invoke `block.call`, the job won't be enqueued
    end
  end

  def perform(...)
    # UniqueJob is an abstract class, we shouldn't enqueue it directly
    raise NotImplementedError
  end
end
```

Now any job that inherits from `UniqueJob` can only be enqueued if a job of that class is not already enqueued, running or scheduled:

```ruby
---
filename: app/jobs/example_job.rb
---
class ExampleJob < UniqueJob
  def perform
    sleep 20
  end
end
```

If I try to enqueue the job twice, the second call will be skipped[^skipped] with a log message:

```ruby

This setup is basically equivalent to the `sidekiq-unique-jobs` configured with `sidekiq_options lock: :until_executed, on_conflict: :log`.

[^skipped]: The log still claims `Enqueued ExampleJob`, but we can see nothing is actually enqueued.
