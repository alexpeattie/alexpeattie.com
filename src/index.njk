    <p>I co-founded and co-ran
      <a href='https://peg.co'>Peg</a>
      - a B2B software platform to help top brands &amp; agencies work with influencers - for five years. It was incredible journey - we worked with over 2,000 companies worldwide, assembled a fantastic team and raised $2M from angel investors. At our peak I managed 8 direct reports and a technology budget of ~$400k annually.</p>

    <p>Peg also offered up plenty of interesting technical challenges. The platform had to track and intelligently rank more than 2 million influencers, tag many billions of photos and videos, and use natural language processing to identify influencers mentioning brands. In 2021, Peg's platform was acquired by 
      <a href='https://current.tech/'>Current</a>, an influencer marketing outfit based in the US.</p>

  <p>Shortly after it was founded, I joined
    <a href='https://makers.tech/'>Makers</a>
    (or Makers Academy as it was known at the time) as a Senior Coach responsible for the second half of the course. I was responsible for running the course's second half focusing on web technologies including Ruby on Rails, SQL and JavaScript.</p>

  <p>It was fun to design a curriculum covering such a breadth of material in just a few weeks, and to teach so many incredible students, who have gone on to jobs at the likes of Facebook, GDS, Thoughtbot, Pusher, Pivotal Labs and Amazon.</p>

  <p>For almost a decade and a half, I've acted as a consulting software engineer or (more recently) interim CTO for a wide range of clients - from Fortune 500 companies, to early stage startups, to charities and NGOs. I also spent a year working on-site with GrubWithUs (now
    <a href='https://www.goat.com/'>GOAT</a>) in Venice Beach. If you'd like to work together,
