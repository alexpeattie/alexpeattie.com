Last month I released the [JustVector Social Icon pack](/projects/justvector-icons/), 100 monochrome vectors for social sites and services. Really, the pack was a selfish endeavour: although there are plenty of social icon packs out there, what I wanted - no frills, full-scaleable vectors for all common sites - was difficult to find. But the feedback I've gotten suggests others have found the icons useful too, and the pack's already clocked up 10K+ downloads.

In that spirit, I'm pleased to roll out the [first update](/projects/justvector-icons) to the pack, adding **50 thoroughly lovely new vectors**. Highlights include icons for Dropbox, Quora, Pinboard and (Apple) Ping, all included by popular demand ([let me know](/about#contact) if there are any icons you'd like to see included). Compatibility has also been improved, the vectors are now CS3+ rather than CS5.

Thanks to some great work by Sergio D&iacute;az the set is now available as a web font. With a little @font-face magic, you can have social icons to resize, recolour and [generally abuse](http://mothereffingtextshadow.com/).
