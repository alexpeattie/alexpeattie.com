Here's a quick Rails question for you. We have a bunch of *Posts* in a Postgres DB which we want to order by publication day - but Posts published on the **same day** should be ordered by a different column: upvotes. (This is basically how [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/tech) does it). We're paginating, so we only care about the first 100 posts. How would we do it?

Maybe you'd start with something like this:

~~~ruby
Post.all.group_by { |post|
  post.published_at.to_date
}.flat_map { |day, posts|
  posts.sort_by(&:score).reverse
}.first(100)
~~~

It's not terrible (it works), it's the [kind of thing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4987392/how-do-i-group-by-day-instead-of-date) you'll find if you Google "rails group by day". The problem with the code is *a)* it's a bit ugly and *b)* is it's not very efficient. Using our `Enumerable` methods (`group_by` and `flat_map`), means we have to load **all** our Posts into memory, sort them with Ruby, then pull out the 100 we care about. This is slow & inefficient.

To get me started I ran this on 30K records, it took about 7 seconds (I didn't profile the memory usage, but I'd expect it to be quite high). So we might get away with using Ruby to order a few hundred records, but this doesn't scale to thousands or millions of records.

Postgres is way faster and doing these kind of sorts (especially with indexes, as we'll see below) - but simply ordering by `published_at` and `upvotes` doesn't give us what we want:

~~~ruby
Post.order('published_at DESC, upvotes DESC').limit(5).pluck(:published_at, :upvotes)
#=> (14.4ms) SELECT "posts"."published_at", "posts"."upvotes" FROM "posts" ORDER BY published_at DESC, upvotes DESC LIMIT 5

[[Fri, 15 Jan 2016 15:25:46 UTC +00:00, 12],
 [Fri, 15 Jan 2016 13:22:11 UTC +00:00, 158],
 [Fri, 15 Jan 2016 12:50:37 UTC +00:00, 88],
 [Thu, 14 Jan 2016 21:48:44 UTC +00:00, 24],
 [Thu, 14 Jan 2016 14:46:51 UTC +00:00, 282]]
~~~

Unless two are added at the same second, the second sort column (upvotes) will never be used. We need to to tell Postgres to sort by the publication *day*, but to ignore the rest of the timestamp.

## Enter `datetrunc`

Luckily we can use super handy function called `date_trunc` for just that (it's documented here). Despite it's handiness I couldn't find any real mention of people using it in a Rails context - although it is used inside the [groupdate gem](https://github.com/ankane/groupdate) which I'd recommend for more complex use-cases, or if you're not using Postgres.

`datetrunc` is really simple, it truncates a date down to a certain precision. If the precision is `'day'` for example, it'll "reset" the date to midnight (a bit like Rails' beginning_of_day method). Let's modify our example above:

~~~ruby
Post.order("date_trunc('day', published_at) DESC, upvotes DESC").limit(5).pluck("date_trunc('day', published_at)", :upvotes)
#=> SELECT date_trunc('day', published_at), "collaborations"."upvotes" FROM "collaborations" ORDER BY date_trunc('day', published_at) DESC, upvotes DESC LIMIT 5

[[2016-01-15 00:00:00 UTC, 158]],
 [2016-01-15 00:00:00 UTC, 88],
 [2016-01-15 00:00:00 UTC, 12]],
 [2016-01-14 00:00:00 UTC, 282]],
 [2016-01-14 00:00:00 UTC, 24]]
~~~

Pretty cool huh? Everything after the day in our publication timestamp is discarded, which means posts from the same day are correctly sorted by upvotes ðŸŽŠ!

We can truncate down to any arbitrary precision, from `'week'` to `'millennium'` (useful for that database of ancient alien races you might be making).

~~~ruby
Post.order("date_trunc('week', published_at)")
Post.order("date_trunc('millennium', published_at)")
~~~

<div class='Callout'>
<p>Be careful, unlike most of the time in Ruby, single/double quotes <strong>aren't</strong> interchangeable here - in Postgres literal strings like <code>'day'</code> <a href='http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-STRINGS'>have to be single-quoted</a>.</p>
</div>

### Using indexes for crazy performance ðŸ”¥

Using `date_trunc` is faster than our plain-Ruby approach from the get-go - running our final query (below) on the same 30K rows takes just 155ms seconds!

~~~ruby
Post.order("date_trunc('day', published_at) DESC, upvotes DESC").limit(100)
#=> Post Load (155.2ms)  SELECT  "posts".* FROM "posts" ORDER BY date_trunc('day', published_at) DESC, upvotes DESC  LIMIT 100
~~~

We can push performance even further by adding an index. We're doing something a bit more complex than just indexing the value of column here, because we're running it through a function first. We'll need expression (or function-based) index. These aren't natively supported in vanilla Rails yet (but there's an [open Pull Request](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13684) to add them), so we'll use the [`schema_plus_pg_indexes`](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_plus_pg_indexes) gem.

With the gem added to our Gemfile, we'll generate a migration

~~~ruby
bin/rails g migration add_creation_day_score_index_to_posts
~~~

Then we'll add our expression index:

~~~ruby
class AddCreationDayScoreIndexToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def up
    add_index :posts, expression: "date_trunc('day', published_at) DESC, score DESC", name: 'posts_creation_day_score_index'
  end

  def down
    remove_index :posts, name: 'posts_creation_day_score_index'
  end

end
~~~

With the index in place, I saw the query complete in **2.2ms** - that's a 70x speedup. Of course 150ms is already pretty fast - but this has real implications if we're grouping by day/month on a really big table.

I tried using `date_trunc` on a collection of videos from [Peg's](https://peg.co) database, with 16 million rows - ordering the Videos' `published_at` day and `view_count`. Without indexing the query took 42 seconds, with indexing it was only - 20ms not much slower than our 30K row table! I didn't even try the pure Ruby version (spoiler alert: you're in for a bad time).

### Conclusion

`date_trunc` is a very handy little function, that lets you group by time period much much quicker than in plain old Ruby. Have you used `date_trunc`? Any tips for getting the most out of it? Let me know in the comments ðŸ˜Š!
