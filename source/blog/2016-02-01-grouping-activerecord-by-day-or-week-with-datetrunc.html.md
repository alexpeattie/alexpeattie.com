title: "Rails tip â€“ Grouping ActiveRecord objects by day or week using <code>datetrunc</code>"
---

Here's a quick Rails question for you. We have a bunch of *Posts* in a Postgres DB which we want to order by publication day - but Posts published on the **same day** should be ordered by a different column: upvotes. (This is basically how [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/tech) does it). How would we do it?

Maybe you'd start with something like this:

~~~ruby
Post.all.group_by { |post|
  post.created_at.to_date
}.flat_map { |day, posts|
  posts.sort_by(&:score).reverse
}
~~~

It's not terrible (it works), it's the [kind of thing](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4987392/how-do-i-group-by-day-instead-of-date) you'll find if you Google "rails group by day". The problem with the code is *a)* it's a bit ugly and *b)* is it's not very efficient. Using our `Enumerable` methods (`group_by` and `flat_map`), means we have to load all our Posts into memory and do the sorting in Ruby - which is relatively slow.

To get me started I ran this on 30K records, it took about 7 seconds (I didn't profile the memory usage, but I'd expect it to be quite high). So we might get away with using Ruby to order a few hundred records, but this doesn't scale to thousands or millions of records.

Postgres is way faster and doing these kind of sorts (especially with indexes, as we'll see below) - but simply ordering by `published_at` and `upvotes` doesn't give us what we want:

~~~ruby
Post.order('published_at DESC, upvotes DESC').limit(5).pluck(:published_at, :upvotes)
#=> (14.4ms) SELECT "posts"."published_at", "posts"."upvotes" FROM "posts" ORDER BY published_at DESC, upvotes DESC LIMIT 5

[[Fri, 15 Jan 2016 15:25:46 UTC +00:00, 12],
 [Fri, 15 Jan 2016 13:22:11 UTC +00:00, 158],
 [Fri, 15 Jan 2016 12:50:37 UTC +00:00, 88],
 [Thu, 14 Jan 2016 21:48:44 UTC +00:00, 24],
 [Thu, 14 Jan 2016 14:46:51 UTC +00:00, 282]]
~~~

Unless two are added at the same second, the second sort column (upvotes) will never be used. We need to to tell Postgres to sort by the publication *day*, but to ignore the rest of the timestamp.

## Enter `datetrunc`

Luckily we can use super handy function called `date_trunc` for just that (it's documented here). Despite it's handiness I couldn't find any real mention of people using it in a Rails context - although it is used inside the [groupdate gem](https://github.com/ankane/groupdate) which I'd recommend for more complex use-cases, or if you're not using Postgres.

`datetrunc` is really simple, it truncates a date down to a certain precision. If the precision is `'day'` for example, it'll "reset" the date to midnight (a bit like Rails' beginning_of_day method). Let's modify our example above:

~~~ruby
Post.order("date_trunc('day', published_at) DESC, upvotes DESC").limit(5).pluck("date_trunc('day', published_at)", :upvotes)
#=> SELECT date_trunc('day', published_at), "collaborations"."upvotes" FROM "collaborations" ORDER BY date_trunc('day', published_at) DESC, upvotes DESC LIMIT 5

[[2016-01-15 00:00:00 UTC, 158]],
 [2016-01-15 00:00:00 UTC, 88],
 [2016-01-15 00:00:00 UTC, 12]],
 [2016-01-14 00:00:00 UTC, 282]],
 [2016-01-14 00:00:00 UTC, 24]]
~~~

Pretty cool huh? Everything after the day in our publication timestamp is discarded, which means posts from the same day are correctly sorted by upvotes ðŸŽŠ!

We can truncate down to any arbitrary precision, from `'week'` to `'millennium'` (useful for that database of ancient alien races you might be making).

~~~ruby
Post.order("date_trunc('week', published_at)")
Post.order("date_trunc('millennium', published_at)")
~~~

<div class='Callout'>
<p>Be careful, unlike most of the time in Ruby, single/double quotes <strong>aren't</strong> interchangeable here - in Postgres literal strings like <code>'day'</code> <a href='http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-STRINGS'>have to be single-quoted</a>.</p>
</div>

### Using indexes for crazy performance ðŸ”¥

Using `date_trunc` is faster than our plain-Ruby approach from the get-go - running it on the same 30K rows took about 1.3 seconds.
