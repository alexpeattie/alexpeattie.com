Earlier this month, I was fortunate enough to be invited by a client to attend TwilioCon 2012 in San Francisco. I'd had some experience working with [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) already, but I definitely came away from the conference having learnt a lot.

Highlights
----------

Some of the highlights of the conference:

- Twilio announcing [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/) support in Twilio Client. Its nice to see Twilio driving the move away from Flash. WebRTC doesn't have any real browser support yet, but this will definitely be a big draw in 2013 and beyond. <br> *\[UPDATE FEB 2013: The latest versions of Chrome and FF now support WebRTC, see [here](http://blog.chromium.org/2013/02/hello-firefox-this-is-chrome-calling.html) and [here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/02/hello-chrome-its-firefox-calling/) respectively.\]*
- [Delyn Simons](https://twitter.com/delynator)' awesome talk on marketing for hackers, which was informative and inspiring. And she gets bonus points in my book for being (slightly) Welsh!
- [Rob Spectre](https://twitter.com/dN0t)'s surprise concert: <http://instagram.com/p/Q5v-ZRgjmJ/>

Lowlights
---------

Some things I thought could have been done better:

- The timing of the workshop sessions. All the workshops took place a day before the main conference, i.e. before things like WebRTC, the usage API, and test credentials were announced. That meant workshop attendees didn't have the opportunity with play with any of the new products
- Although the conference had 1000+ attendees, the space was massive. That did meant things felt a little empty at times.

But, overall, it was a great experience. And as an extra bonus, I discovered an excellent spot for authentic Fish & Chips (run by a Brit) at Fisherman's Wharf, which I'd *highly* recommend: [The Codmother](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-codmother-fish-and-chips-san-francisco-2).
