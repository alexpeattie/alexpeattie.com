title: 'Why you might want to silence console.log'
---

`console.log` might be the most useful debugging tool in a front-end coder's arsenal. If you aren't using it, go read [Mastering Console Logging](http://archive.fo/DVhyA/) to see why its so awesome.

But `console.log` statements can potentially break things - IE8 and below will throw a JS error (unless the Developer Console is active), which effectively halting the execution of your Javascript. One solution[^1] to this is to create an empty `console.log` function if it doesn't exist:

~~~javascript
// Stop console.log causing failures in IE
if (typeof console === "undefined" || typeof console.log === "undefined") {
  console = {};
  console.log = function() {};
}
~~~

The console should really just be used for development purposes - but if you don't want to meticulously remove every `console.log` statement from your production site, you can use the same trick:

~~~erb
// In a .js.erb file in Rails
<% if Rails.env.production? %>
  console = {};
  console.log = function() {};
<% end %>
~~~
